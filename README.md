- [ExamCompass](https://www.examcompass.com/comptia/security-plus-certification/free-security-plus-practice-tests) [free material]
My favorite source of questions. The questions are divided into over 25 tests, each test contains from 20 to 40 questions. The questions are great as a revision after going through the corresponding part of the material, e.g. by watching Prof Messer's videos.

In my opinion, the questions do not cover the required material 1 to 1, I recommend treating the questions as a kind of extension of the material, or possibly repetition.
